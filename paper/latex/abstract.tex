\begin{abstract}
Scholarly data is mostly fragmented across siloed databases with divergent metadata and missing links between them. We present the Science Data Lake, a locally-deployable infrastructure built on DuckDB and simple parquet files that unifies eight open sources---Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex, SciSciNet, Papers with Code, Retraction Watch, Reliance on Science, a preprint-to-published mapping, and Crossref---via DOI normalization while preserving source-level schemas. The resource comprises approximately 1\,TB of Parquet files spanning nearly 300~million uniquely identifiable papers across 22~schemas and 151~SQL views. An embedding-based ontology alignment using BGE-large maps 4,516 OpenAlex topics to 13~scientific ontologies (1.3~million terms), yielding 16,150 mappings with 99.8\% topic coverage---a 17-fold improvement over string matching. We validate through 10~automated checks, cross-source citation agreement analysis (pairwise Pearson $r = 0.76$--$0.87$), and manual inspection. Four vignettes demonstrate cross-source analyses infeasible with any single database. The resource is open source, deployable on a single drive or queryable
remotely via HuggingFace, and includes structured documentation designed for LLM-based research agents.
