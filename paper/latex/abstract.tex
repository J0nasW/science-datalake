\begin{abstract}
Scholarly data is fragmented across siloed databases with incompatible identifiers
and divergent metadata. We present the Science Data Lake, a locally-deployable
infrastructure built on DuckDB and Apache Parquet that unifies eight open sources---Semantic
Scholar, OpenAlex, SciSciNet, Papers with Code, Retraction Watch, Reliance on Science,
a preprint-to-published mapping, and Crossref---via DOI normalization while preserving
source-level schemas. The resource comprises 293~million unique papers across 22~schemas
and 151~SQL views. An embedding-based ontology alignment using BGE-large maps 4,516
OpenAlex topics to 13~scientific ontologies (1.3~million terms), yielding 16,150
mappings with 99.8\% topic coverage---a 17-fold improvement over string matching. We
validate through 10~automated checks, cross-source citation agreement analysis (pairwise
Pearson $r = 0.76$--$0.87$), and manual inspection. Four vignettes demonstrate
cross-source analyses infeasible with any single database. The resource is open source
and deployable on a single drive or via HuggingFace.
